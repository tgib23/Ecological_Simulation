=====================

We'll get together to work on a Ruby problem.   This week let's try writing a simulation of a tiny ecology to see how generations of mice and cats in the barn coexist without a population crash.

We are building an ecological simulation of a barn!  The barn starts out filled with x amount of grain, y amount of cats and z amount of mice.   Your goal is to maximize the amount of grain left at the end of the simulation run for the farmer sells for profit. 

Each day, the mice eat quantity a of grain, and the cats eat quantity b of mice. 

The mice reproduce each day at rate c, and the cats reproduce every other day at rate d. 

Mice live and reproduce for e days.  Cats live and reproduce for f days.


Run the simulation to determine:

1. What rates are needed to keep the ecosystem going (if the cats and mice are all dead the ecosystem is dead too) 
2. What rates are needed to keep some mice and cats and and maximize the amount of grain left for the farmer to sell.

This will require some trial and error and figuring out a way to show the status for each day so you can see how it's going.
